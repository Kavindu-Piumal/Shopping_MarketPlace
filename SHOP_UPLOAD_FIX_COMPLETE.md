# 🏪 Shop Logo & Banner Upload Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Separated Loading States** ✅
- **Before**: Single `imageUploading` state caused both logo and banner to show loading when uploading either
- **After**: Separate `logoUploading` and `bannerUploading` states
- **Files Modified**: `f:\web\abc\client\src\pages\MyShop.jsx`

### 2. **Enhanced Upload Function** ✅
- **Modified**: `handleImageUpload` function to:
  - Set appropriate loading state based on image type (logo/banner)
  - Upload image to server first
  - Update shop with image URL
  - Immediately refresh shop state for instant visibility
  - Clear correct loading state when complete

### 3. **Updated Upload UI** ✅
- **Fixed**: Input elements now use separate loading states
- **Fixed**: Loading overlays show for correct input only
- **Result**: Users can upload logo and banner simultaneously without UI conflicts

### 4. **Enhanced Shop Display** ✅
- **MyShop.jsx**: Updated shop header to display uploaded images
  - Banner as background image with overlay for text readability
  - Logo in circular container with proper fallbacks
- **ShopDetailPage.jsx**: Updated to display uploaded logo and banner in public view
- **ShopsPage.jsx**: Updated shop cards to show uploaded logo and banner

### 5. **Fixed Missing Controller Export** ✅
- **Issue**: `updateShopStatusController` was missing from exports
- **Fixed**: Added missing controller function to `shop.controller.js`
- **Result**: Admin functionality for shop status management works correctly

## 🎯 KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **State Management**
```javascript
const [logoUploading, setLogoUploading] = useState(false);
const [bannerUploading, setBannerUploading] = useState(false);
```

### **Upload Function Logic**
```javascript
const handleImageUpload = async (imageType, file) => {
  // Set loading state based on image type
  if (imageType === 'logo') {
    setLogoUploading(true);
  } else {
    setBannerUploading(true);
  }
  
  // Upload logic...
  
  // Clear loading state based on image type
  if (imageType === 'logo') {
    setLogoUploading(false);
  } else {
    setBannerUploading(false);
  }
};
```

### **UI Loading States**
```jsx
<input
  type="file"
  disabled={logoUploading}  // Only disabled when logo uploading
  // ...
/>

{logoUploading && (
  <div className="loading-overlay">Uploading...</div>
)}
```

### **Image Display in Public Views**
```jsx
{/* Shop Banner */}
{shop.banner && (
  <img 
    src={shop.banner} 
    alt="Shop Banner" 
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
)}

{/* Shop Logo */}
{shop.logo ? (
  <img 
    src={shop.logo} 
    alt="Shop Logo" 
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
) : (
  <FaStore className="text-emerald-600" />
)}
```
