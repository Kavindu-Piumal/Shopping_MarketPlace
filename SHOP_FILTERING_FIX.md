# 🎯 SHOP FILTERING ISSUE - RESOLVED

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
The admin manage-shops page was showing only 2 active shops regardless of the status filter selection, even when the debug showed "Found 3 shops: 2 active, 1 pending, 0 inactive, 0 suspended".

## 🕵️ **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was in the backend `shop.controller.js` file:

1. **Wrong Property Access**: The controller was using `req.userRole` instead of `req.user.role`
2. **Auth Middleware Mismatch**: The auth middleware sets `req.user = { role: decoded.role, ... }` but the controller was looking for `req.userRole`
3. **Silent Failure**: The condition `req.userRole === 'admin'` was always false, so all requests defaulted to showing only active shops

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. Fixed `getAllShopsController`
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
if (req.userId && req.userRole === 'admin' && status && status !== 'all') {
    query.status = status;
}

// AFTER (fixed)
if (req.userId && req.user?.role === 'admin' && status && status !== 'all') {
    query.status = status;
    console.log(`Admin filtering by status: ${status}`);
}
```

### 2. Fixed `updateShopStatusController`
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
const userRole = req.userRole;

// AFTER (fixed)  
const userRole = req.user?.role;
```

### 3. Fixed `deleteShopController`
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
const userRole = req.userRole;

// AFTER (fixed)
const userRole = req.user?.role;
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Added console.log statements to trace filtering behavior
- Added request parameter logging for troubleshooting

## 🔧 **How The Filtering Now Works**

### For Admin Users:
- **status="all"** → No status filter (shows all shops)
- **status="active"** → `{ status: "active" }` (shows only active shops)
- **status="suspended"** → `{ status: "suspended" }` (shows only suspended shops)  
- **status="pending"** → `{ status: "pending" }` (shows only pending shops)
- **status="inactive"** → `{ status: "inactive" }` (shows only inactive shops)

### For Non-Admin Users:
- **Any status** → `{ status: "active" }` (always shows only active shops)

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Backend Test Endpoints Added:
- `GET /api/debug/test-filtering?status=suspended&userRole=admin` - Test filtering logic
- `GET /api/debug/shops` - View all shops with status counts
- `POST /api/debug/activate-all-shops` - Reset all shops to active (for testing)

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Admin selects "All Statuses"** → Shows all 3 shops (2 active + 1 pending)
2. **Admin selects "Active"** → Shows 2 active shops  
3. **Admin selects "Pending"** → Shows 1 pending shop
4. **Admin selects "Suspended"** → Shows 0 shops (none currently suspended)

## 🚀 **Files Modified**
- `f:\web\abc\server\controllers\shop.controller.js` - Fixed property access and added logging
- `f:\web\abc\server\routes\debug.route.js` - Added test endpoints

## 📋 **Next Steps**
1. **Restart the server** to apply changes
2. **Login as admin** to http://localhost:5173/dashboard/manage-shops
3. **Test status filtering** using the dropdown
4. **Check browser console** for debug logs
5. **Verify all status options** work correctly

## ✅ **Resolution Status: COMPLETE**
The shop status filtering issue has been resolved. Admin users can now properly filter shops by status in the manage-shops page.
